			<hr>

			<p>'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br>
			Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.<br>
			The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br>
			In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.</p>

			<img src="img/page-1.png" alt="Older children preparing their stockings for Saint Nicolas's arrival, while Mother tends to baby.">

			<p>The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br>
			While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.<br>
			And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,<br>
			Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.</p>

			<p>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br>
			I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br>
			Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br>
			Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.</p>

			<img src="img/page-2.png" alt="Saint Nicolas arriviving in his sleigh, pulled by eight tiny reindeer.">

			<p>The moon on the breast of the new&ndash;fallen snow<br>
			Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.<br>
			When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>
			But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.</p>

			<p>With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br>
			I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.<br>
			More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br>
			And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!</p>

			<img src="img/page-3.png" alt="Saint Nicolas's sleigh decending upon a rooftop.">

			<p><em>"Now Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!<br>
			On, Comet! On, Cupid! On Donner and Blitzen!<br>
			To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!<br>
			Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"</em></p>

			<p>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br>
			When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.<br>
			So up to the house&ndash;top the coursers they flew,<br>
			With the sleigh full of Toys, and St. Nicholas, too.</p>

			<p>And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br>
			The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br>
			As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br>
			Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.</p>

			<p>He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br>
			And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.<br>
			A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,<br>
			And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.</p>

			<img src="img/page-4.png" alt="Saint Nicolas giving a little wink before assending the chimney.">

			<p>His eyes&ndash;how they twinkled! His dimples how merry!<br>
			His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br>
			His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br>
			And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.</p>

			<p>The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br>
			And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.<br>
			He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br>
			That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!</p>

			<p>He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br>
			And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!<br>
			A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br>
			Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.</p>

			<p>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br>
			And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.<br>
			And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br>
			And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!</p>

			<img src="img/page-5.png" alt="Saint Nicholas leaving the house in his sleigh, wishing a Happy Christmas to all.">

			<p>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br>
			And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br>
			But I heard him exclaim, as he drove out of sight,<br>
			<em>"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"</em></p>
